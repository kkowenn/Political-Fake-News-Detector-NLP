# Fake News Detector

**Deep Learning Machine University Project!**

We have decided to make an improvement on this research project: [Fake News Detector RNN](https://www.kaggle.com/code/muhammadwaseem123/fake-news-detector-rnn).

We trained our model with the RNN algorithm with "secretto hush-hush" optimization to improve the model's accuracy. Feel free to use our model!

**Kaggle Dataset:**
